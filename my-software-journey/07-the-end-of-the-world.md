Spring of 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic hit. My employer’s sales figures were impacted by the resulting lockdowns. As a result, they had to lay-off a few dozen employees. Being a contractor, I feared that I would be let go but I was reassured by the new CIO that my role was safe.

The CIO asked me if I would be willing to take over the maintenance of the company’s global web presence and online product catalog and I agreed to help out. She was smart, optimistic, and I really valued her ability to make me feel genuinely appreciated.

I inherited a project that had accumulated a great deal of negativity and pessimism. The previous designer and developer had a difficult working relationship and my sense is that the developer did not enjoy their role and had a hard time being productive. The designer was either fired or quit. The developer maligned the software platform to his colleagues. I found out that years back the project manager and my programmer colleague had asked to be removed from maintaining the company web presence because of how stressful it was to work on it.

I inherited another project that was also in a bad spot. Prior to the CIO joining the company there was no central coordination of technology workers and teams worked independently to hire their own programmers and contractors. This project was an iOS app built by contractors that was months behind schedule and was having persistent quality issues.

I stepped into these challenges with a spirit of wanting to help out my new colleagues within this company. I felt that I had the experience needed to shore up technical debt and improve processes in a way to make these projects successful. I felt validated when we finally released the first fully-functioning version of the iOS app. I felt validated when I started being able to extend and address any issue with the website infrastructure in a reasonable time frame.

I was very fortunate to still be employed during the lockdowns. However, I chose to live alone. The resulting extreme isolation and the loss of my music community plunged me into profound depression and anxiety that exacerbated my chronic pain issues.

Challenges I experienced in these new roles included:

- Lack of documentation of testing and deployment processes. I addressed this and the person who took over for me shot me a message months later on LinkedIn expressing gratitude for my extensive documentation.
- Lack of buy-in on necessary automated testing for the front-end presence.
- Lack of detail in tracking long-term projects and corresponding lack of written specifications in the issue tracker.
- Being made to feel less-than for being a contractor by a manager that was added to grow the technology team.
- I have found that the quality and speed tradeoffs that result when outsourcing work to an agency can be significant. In my experience, working with agency developers can be like finding yourself suddenly surrounded by coworkers that have not been interviewed, vetted, and tested. I think that it can negatively impact morale if you hire a team of agency developers without consulting your staff developers first and involving them in selecting and vetting the agency developers.
- In both the cases of the website project and the iOS project I experienced what can result when software projects are initiated by teams that are lacking technical expertise and technical leadership. When severe quality issues that delay a project can appear, for example, a team that lacks technical leadership may not know to recommend unit testing or put in place a rigorous workflow documenting issues in an issue tracker.
- Our web presence was written in WordPress and relied on custom PHP code. I participated in trying to hire senior-level talent to work on this system and it was a struggle.
- While searching for a senior web developer we hired someone who had a couple red flags for both myself and another interviewer. They turned out to communicate in a confrontational and combative manner. Since I was the primary technical contact on web projects I bore the brunt of their outbursts. It was quite traumatic to have to deal with this in the middle of pandemic lockdowns and personal life stress.

There were some great positives in this role, however:

- I regularly interacted with women more in this role than in any other roles. I love being able to work in teams of women because of my gender fluidity and natural tendency toward a more vulnerable, emotional, playful, feminine side.
- Even though I don’t want to be a full-time manager, it was a good experience to be able to exercise my managerial skills and it was satisfying to be able to stabilize two different projects as a result.
- I had the opportunity to mentor a really smart and talented intern and was proud to see him be able to step into a full developer role only months afterward.
- I had a really satisfying working relationship with several of my new coworkers including the CIO.
- The CIO granted me a raise when I asked for one. This let me save up money for a downpayment and repairs on a home. The previous “big boss”, a CTO, would not give me this raise.

I ultimately decided to leave the role for a few different reasons. I was experiencing signs of burnout again. At one point I asked to take two weeks off because my stress and burnout was so bad and I didn’t really have the energy to plan any kind of vacation. I cut my working hours to 25 hours a week. I didn’t feel respected by the manager that had taken over direct supervision of me from my CIO.

Early on, I let my CIO know that I had the intention of leaving my role but that I would take my time and make sure that the transition was as smooth as possible. I put feelers out on my network and I found out that the CTO from my Utah role was hiring again! I reached out and we began the interview / hiring process.

Then my role suddenly became sharply stressful – my programmer colleague that I had worked with for seven years gave his two weeks notice. I was informed that we were going to hire an outsourcing firm again and that we wouldn’t be able to send them macOS systems. This meant that I had to try and figure out how to support our Dockerized application on Windows and it quickly became apparent that making this happen was going to require a huge amount of effort or not be possible at all.

Fortunately I was able to finalize the hiring process for a new role also based in Utah at a company with a very strong mission to make their employees feel happy and productive. I would also get a chance to work with AI and Clojure again :]
