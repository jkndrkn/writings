# Questions:

## Why do you use they/them/their pronouns?

I identify as a genderfluid or genderqueer nonbinary person. Being referred to as "man", "bro", "dude", etc. has never felt right to me. I am most comfortable when I can express my femme side.

## Oh no, I referred to you using he/him! What should I do?

Quickly apologize and correct yourself in the moment and then continue with the conversation. Please don't display a lot of guilt or apologize profusely.

## I am having a hard time remembering to use your pronouns correctly. What can I do?

Even other trans and nonbinary people who themselves have changed their pronouns have trouble adjusting when their friends change their pronouns.

I find that it's helpful for me to rehearse referring to someone by their new pronouns in my head. Practice makes perfect!

## I practice all the time and I am still having trouble using your pronouns correctly!

You can just refer to me as John David and not use any pronouns :]
